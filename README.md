# Description

Simple Python script to scrape the SpaceX API returning the latest launch information.  Specifically, the launch name, date, and details.  Also, the ship name, type, and home port for all ships in the latest launch.  It displays the information on the command line.

# Requirements

pandas

requests

# Command

python3 SpaceX_scrape.py

# Improvements

If I had more time, I would have displayed the information in a more visualising pleasing way.  However, I have limited experience with React, so decided to display it on the command line to save time.

There is a lot of data in the API, so more interesting things could be derived, but it was out of scope for this task.
